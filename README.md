This blog was created for teachers to share their experiences about classroom management, professional growth and any other issues that they face during the school year. It functions like a shared journal where users can log in to see the entries of other teachers or post for themselves. Posts are stored on the dashboard with the most recent first as evidenced by a time stamp on each post.
